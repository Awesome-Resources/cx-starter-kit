# Cx Starter Kit

This is the boilerplate for new Cx projects.

## Usage

Install required packages by running:
	
	npm install
	
in the root folder. You can start the demo app by:

	npm start
	
By default, the development server runs on port 8088 in order to allow
running Cx docs development server on the same machine simultaneously.

    npm run build
    
Create a production build.
